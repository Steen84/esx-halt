esx-halt.sh - Simple script to safely halt an ESXi host from ssh
Copyright (C) 2011  Davide Ferrari

esx-halt is a very simple bash script that, given an ESXi host as input,
connects to it via SSH and shutdown (or power off) all the virtual
machines inside it, and then safely halt the host.

It could be useful if you want to shutdown the ESXi host from an UPS
daemon (i.e. apcsupsd) and you cannot use the ESXi API calls due to
license restrictions.
